  together to claim a Power Star. The villainous giant crow Wingo appears 
  and steals the star, taking Toadette along with him when she grabs hold 
  of it. The player guides Toad as he tracks Wingo down to his lair and 
  rescues Toadette. In the second chapter of the story, the introductory 
  scenario plays out again, but this time Toad is kidnapped and the 
  player assumes control of Toadette. After Toad is rescued and Wingo 
  reemerges again, Toadette is kidnapped and Toad is knocked off of 
  Wingo's tower. Then, the third chapter of the story begins, in which 
  both Toad and Toadette venture through levels on their way to the 
  showdown with Wingo, along the way defeating Draggadon, the king of 
  Pyropuff Peak, for the third time.
